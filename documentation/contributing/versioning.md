# Versioning

This library uses a versioning scheme similar to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) where:

  - Breaking changes are marked as major (1.X.X)
  - New features or deprecations are marked as minor (X.1.X)
  - Bug fixes are marked as a patch (X.X.1)

Any change or contribution that has been made should be recorded in the [change notes](../../ChangeNotes.txt). There should be a description of changes made along with a reasoning for why.
Changes should be categorised as:

  - Breaking Change
  - New Feature
  - Fix

Versioning updates and publication are managed by the development team. External contributors should not attempt to bump the library version. These changes will not be accepted.

Always consume the latest published version of the library to ensure you have the most up-to-date features and fixes.
