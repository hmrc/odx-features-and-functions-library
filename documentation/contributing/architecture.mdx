# Application architecture

The HMRC ODX Features and Functions library is evolving, and while its structure may change, a consistent enough pattern has emerged to guide file organisation.

```console
    src
    ├── FeatureName
    │   ├── utils
    │   │   └── helpers.ts
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── FeatureFile.ts
    │   ├── FeatureFile.tsx
    │   └── index.ts
    └── helpers
        └── helper.ts
    test
    ├── FeatureName
    │   └── FeatureFile.test.tsx
    └── integration
        └── FeatureName.integration.test.tsx
```

  - **src/FeatureName/utils/**: Contains helper functions used across feature files.
  - **src/FeatureName/README**: Guide for the purpose of the feature and instructions on how to implement.
  - **src/FeatureName/FeatureFile**: Files with feature logic may be `.ts` or `.tsx` depending on the file content. There can be as many as necessary.
  - **src/FeatureName/index.ts**: Expose functionalities for easy importing elsewhere.
  - **src/helpers/**: Contains helper functions that need accessed at a global level.
  - **test/FeatureName/**: Contains unit tests for a given feature or function file.
  - **test/integration/FeatureName/**: Contains integration tests for a given feature or function.
