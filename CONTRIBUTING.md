# Guidelines for Contributing

HMRC ODX Feature and Functions is a public repository and we welcome outside contributions - this document aims to help outside contributors to follow our processes and standards.
If you have any questions, you can [contact us](inbox to be set up).


## Code of Conduct

Please refer to our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand expected behaviours from our contributors.

## Fork Repository

If you are an outside contributor, please make sure to [fork this project](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) as a first step.

Downstream forks are permitted. The team requests that any changes that are universally applicable to the library are raised against the upstream project and made available to us. We may also contact owners of downstream forks in the event that a feature has been developed that we would like to include in the main library.


## Running locally

Install the library with `npm install hmrc-odx-features-and-functions`. See documentation on [publishing locally](/documentation/contributing/publishing-locally.mdx) to see how features can be implemented locally while testing.


## Conventions to follow

See documentation on [coding conventions](/documentation/contributing/coding-conventions.mdx) for guidance.


## Raising an issue against the library

You can raise an [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) within the library to create a PR against.
When opening an issue, please include reproduction steps, screenshots or screen recordings, and clearly describe the expected vs actual behaviour. The team reserves the right to reject issues.


## Application architecture

See documentation on [architecture](/documentation/contributing/architecture.mdx) for guidance on expected file structure.


## Testing

See documentation on [testing](/documentation/contributing/testing.mdx) for guidance.


## Versioning

See documentation on [versioning](/documentation/contributing/versioning.md) for guidance.


## Updating change notes, README files and Storybook documentation

Any change or contribution that has been made should be recorded in the [change notes](/ChangeNotes.txt). There should be a description of changes made along with a reasoning for why.
If any changes have been made that affect how a component or functionality needs to be implemented then please ensure that this is reflected in the relevant documentation so that consumers will be aware of this.
